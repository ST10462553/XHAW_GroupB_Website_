## <u>Project Brief<u>:
**Empowering the Nation, a local small-to- mid-size enterprise(SME) run by Precious Radebe(said client) has requested for a web and application development service to create what will be a guideline to potential consumers interested in joining one or more courses. Precious insists that both the website and the application’s layout detailing – images, fonts and colours should project an image portraying professionalism. The client provides a brief history of the business which should be part of the app/ website to give the reader insight of the history, mission, vision, goals and objectives of the business. The platforms must emphasise efficiently to potential clients the different course options between six-week and six-month courses along with their fees, objectives (purposes) and content covered within the courses.**
